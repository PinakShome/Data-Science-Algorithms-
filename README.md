## Data Science Algorithms

## Overview

This repository is a comprehensive collection of data science algorithms implemented in Python, focusing on practical applications in various scenarios. Each script within this repository demonstrates a specific algorithm, detailing its use case, implementation, and potential in solving real-world data problems.

## Algorithms Overview

## Small World Phenomenon

Description: This script analyzes social network connections to test the small world phenomenon, often quoted as "six degrees of separation." It includes a function to load graph data from a file, a custom queue class, breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm implementation, and a function to compute the distribution of all distances within the graph.

## Maximize Stock Profits
Description: The algorithm implemented in this script processes stock market data to calculate the maximum potential profit from buying and selling stocks. It identifies the best days to buy and sell a specific stock, aiming to help in financial decision-making.

## Portfolio Optimization

Description: This script revolves around Portfolio Optimization using dynamic programming, akin to solving the 0/1 Knapsack problem. The script includes functions to load investment options from a file and optimize the allocation of funds across these investments to maximize return. It employs a 2D table for dynamic programming and includes a traceback table to identify the chosen investments. The task emphasizes a recursive approach to include or exclude each investment, considering the available funds and potential returns.

To run these scripts, clone the repository and execute each Python file with the appropriate data files. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed, as specified in each script's comments.

Dependencies

Python 3.x
pandas (for data manipulation)
scikit-learn (for algorithmic implementations, if applicable)
numpy (for numerical computations)
